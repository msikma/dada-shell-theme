# Dada Shell Theme Â© 2019

# This file contains a Cron job function that runs periodically.
# The Cron job cache is located in ~/.cache/dada/cron/, and the log files
# contain a year and month such as 'cron_201905.log' for May 2019.

set cron_name com.dada.crontab
set cron_plist $cron_name.plist
set cron_plist_path ~/Library/LaunchAgents/$cron_plist

# Note: somehow set_color commands causes lines not to be logged properly,
# even when the colors are stripped out before saving them to the file.
# This only occurs when the script is being run by launchd.
# Presumably there's a problem with set_color when Fish Shell doesn't have a tty.
